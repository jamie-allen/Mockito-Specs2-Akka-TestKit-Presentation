# Agenda

* Akka TestKit
* Specs2
* Mockito
* See how they come together

!SLIDE bullets incremental transition=blindY
.notes Creating blocking actors is harder in Akka 2.0 from a message-passing perspective, but actors can still encapsulate blocking, side-effecting behaviors (calling to a database, putting data in an external message queue, etc). Wrap those behaviors in future calls with timeouts!
# Akka TestKit

* A testing framework for Akka actors
* Can handle blocking and asynchronous tests
* Please do not write blocking actors
	* You will make Viktor Klang angry
	* You won't like Viktor Klang when he's angry

.notes Deterministic with respect to order of events and no concurrency concerns.
# Actor Testing Models

* Unit Test
	* Isolated
	* Single-threaded
	* Deterministic
* Integration Test
	* Multiple and Encapsulated
	* Multithreaded
	* Non-deterministic

.notes Actors just don't respond to messages, they can become/unbecome.  NEVER define public methods on your actor.  They would also be exposed by TestActorRef, and ActorRef should in general mask any ability to call those methods.  But the real problem is that if someone DOES get a reference to your actor, they can call into the actor with another thread, which introduces the very concurrency issues you're trying to avoid by using actors!
# Why TestActorRef?

* Uncertain behavior and responses of Actors
* ActorRef shields actors, only interaction by messages/mailboxes
* TestActorRef also exposes the underlying reference, direct access to receive

!SLIDE transition=blindY
.notes Gives you more flexibility to interact with actors using testing tools and frameworks that are more geared to traditional classes.  But why would you do this?  The reason is to test expectations that an actor will throw the correct exception if something illegal occurs, from a unit test perspective.  From an integration perspective, you would want to force the error and then check that the actor is properly restarted based on your defined strategy.  Note that you now have a direct reference to that specific instance of the actor - if the actor is restarted, you do not have a reference to the new instance wrapped in that TestActorRef.  However, this is useful if you want to perform post-mortem checks on the actor.
# How to Access the Underlying Actor

	val actorRef = TestActorRef[MyActor]
	val actor = actorRef.underlyingActor

	actor.receive("hello") // <- NOT A MESSAGE, NOT IN MAILBOX!

!SLIDE transition=blindY
# An Example of a Direct Call to Test Exceptions

	import akka.testkit.TestActorRef
	 
	val actorRef = TestActorRef(new Actor {
	  def receive = {
	    case boom â‡’ throw new IllegalArgumentException("boom")
	  }
	})

	// NOTE: You don't need the ".underlying" call on the actorRef
	intercept[IllegalArgumentException] { actorRef.receive("hello") }

!SLIDE transition=blindY
.notes This just sends a message to an actor and expects a message of a specific type back
# Simple TestKit Test

	"A MyActor" should "respond asynchronously to a message" in {
      val testDuration = Duration(2, SECONDS)
      implicit val timeout = Timeout(testDuration)

      val myActorRef = TestActorRef[MyActor]

      myActorRef ! DataQuery("foo", "bar")

      expectMsgClass(testDuration, classOf[MyResponse])
    }

!SLIDE transition=blindY
.notes What is wrong with this test?  This example has no way to capture the result of the future call
# Bad TestKit Test

	// WHAT IS WRONG HERE?

    "A MyActor" should "receive a response to this message" in {
      val testDuration = Duration(2, SECONDS)
      implicit val timeout = Timeout(testDuration)

      val myActorRef = TestActorRef[MyActor]

      myActorRef ? MyMessageToGetSomeData

      expectMsgClass(testDuration, classOf[MyResponse])
    }

!SLIDE transition=blindY
# Good TestKit Test

    "A MyActor" should "receive a response to this message" in {
      val testDuration = Duration(2, SECONDS)
      implicit val timeout = Timeout(testDuration)

      val myActorRef = TestActorRef[MyActor]

      val response = Await.result(myActorRef ? 
                       DataQuery("foo","bar"),
                         testDuration).asInstanceOf[MyResponse]

      response should not be ('empty)
    }

.notes Created in the model of earlier frameworks, such as EasyMock and JMock
# Mockito

* Technically, a "Test Spy Framework"
* Verify behaviors 
* Stub methods

.notes You had to manage your anonymous implementations to show that something occurred, or that it happened the correct number of times. This doesn't look TOO bad below, but if you had interfaces/traits that are very large (a smell test in itself), or had to use external libraries with large interfaces/traits that you couldn't control, it got out of hand very quickly.
# Why Use Mockito?

	// Some interface orthogonal to the class we're testing
    trait MyInterface {  
      def testCall
    }

    // Anonymous impl allowing us to verify results
    val myImpl = new MyInterface() { 
      var _callCount = 0
      def callCount = _callCount
      override def testCall() = callCount += 1
    }

    myImpl.callCount // res0: Int = 0

    // How to verify expected results
    myImpl.testCall
    assert(myImpl.callCount == 1) // res2: Int = 1

!SLIDE transition=blindY
# The Same Logic with Mockito

	// Some interface orthogonal to the class we're testing
    trait MyInterface {  
      def testCall
    }

    import org.mockito.Mockito._
	val myMockImpl = mock(classOf[MyInterface])


!SLIDE bullets incremental transition=blindY
# Benefits of Mockito

* Replaces the need for anonymous implementations of interfaces/traits
* Can stub classes and interfaces/traits with the same API
* Separates logic of expectations with the verification of results

.notes Static methods would be those on Objects.  Important to avoid shared mocks to avoid thread safety issues if tests are executed in parallel
# Things Not To Do with Mockito

* Do not mock final classes
* Do not mock final methods
* Do not mock static methods
* Do not mock equals() or hashCode()
* Cannot mock private methods
* Avoid "shared" mocks

# Example of Shared Mock

.notes Depends on objenesis, which may not work on J9. The limitation of objenesis should only be a production concern?
# Things to Note About Mockito

* Might not be supported on all VMs
* Only use it to mock dependencies via a service interface
